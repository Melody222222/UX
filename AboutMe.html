<h2>About Me...</h2><p id="aboutMeSummary">I am a purpose driven person who is very passionate about making the world a better place. I like working for companies that have values that align to my own. When I join a company, I join a family. <br><br>


    I have a Bacherlor of Arts in Psychology and have years of customer interfacing experience. I enjoy providing customers with exceptional service and I have also been recently been nominated and presented with an award as recognition for being the most "Solutions First" employee at my company for 2022.<br>
    <br>
    Out of interest, I decided to try a front end development bootcamp as I was fascinated by programming and wanted to learn more about it. I painfully (very painfully <img id="smile" src="./websiteImages/smile.png" alt="smiley face">) managed to get through this and came across a chapter on UX design. I spent that evening eagerly consuming content about UX Design and signed up for a Diploma in UX design the very next day.<br> <br>Having worked in many different industries and in start up environments dealing with clients and customers, I would empathize and see users points of view when it came to our service offerings and champion changes that I believed needed to be heard. I adapt and learn quickly, I am capable, passionate, driven and would be an asset to any organisation that provides me the room to grow and the opportunity to learn.<br>
    
    
    <br>You see, UX is not just a career to me, I believe UX is a way to contribute to the world in a very influencial and indisputable way. 
    
    
    Because anytime we can take a process to simply and save others time and effort is valuable. Because time really is the most precious thing we have. Imaging a world where UX is implemented in all steps of our lives has the power to change the world. 
    
    <br>
    <br>Each minute we can save someone is  a minute that is “gifted” back to that person to use towards spending time doing things that matter to them in their own lives or the lives of others. Companies that invest in UX Design are companies that care about their users time and I want to be a part of that. That is why UX Design means so much to me, and its impact on the lives of others.
