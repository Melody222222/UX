<h1>About Me...</h1><p id="aboutMeSummary">I am a purpose driven person who is very passionate about making the world a better place. I work for companies I am proud to be associated with, that have values that align to my own. When I join a company, I join a family. <br><br>


    I have a Bacherlor of Arts in Psychology and have years of customer interfacing experience. I would observe times our processes were not helpful to customers and would question how we could solve these efficiently, so much so, I won our culture principle award for "Solutions First" at Nova Pioneer because I strive to find fixes and improvements and enjoy doing so.<br>
    
    <br>
    Out of interest, I decided to try a front end development bootcamp as I was fascinated by programming and in another attempt to find where I belong. I very painfully managed to get through this and came across a chapter on UX design. <br><br>
    
    
    I could not believe what I was reading. I spent the rest of my free time that evening consuming content about UX Design. I signed up for a Diploma in UX design the very next day. I knew right away with absolute confidence and clarity that I had finally found my place in this world having worked in many different industries and in start up environments dealing with clients and customers, I could empathize and see Users points of view when it came to our service offerings. I adapt and learn quickly, I am capable, passionate and driven and would be an asset to any organisation that provides me the room to grow and the opportunity to learn.<br>
    
    
    <br>You see, UX is not just a career to me, I believe UX is a way to contribute to the world in a very influencial and indisputable way. 
    
    
    Because anytime we can take a process, simplify it, save others time, effort and energy is valuable, because time really is the most precious thing we have. Imaging a world where UX is implemented in all steps of our lives has the power to change the world. 
    
    <br>
    <br>Each minute we can save someone is  a minute that is “gifted” back to that person to use towards spending time with people they love, doing things they love, and doing something meaningful in their own lives or the lives of others. That is why UX Design means so much to me, and its impact on the lives of others.
