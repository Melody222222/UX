      <div id="theIssue">
        <h5 id="headingThree">The Issues:</h5>

        <p>

          I currently worked at Nova Pioneer dealing within customer service, there were moments when new parents would
          talk to me about their confusion on our application and enrollment process. <br> Parents found it time
          consuming and we have had parents abandon the enrollment process altogether due to the confusion and the
          redundant steps many parents had to take when they had more than one child to enrol.
          The information for enrollment and fees was not in a central area and parents would spend a lot of time trying
          to locate fee information and completing the application form. Parents were not given a clear understanding on
          the steps this process involved which left users confused and frustrated. <br>
          There are also no shortened application options for parents who currently already had children at Nova
          Pioneer, which meant current parents had to go through this process again too when enrolling additional
          children.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

  </div>

  </div>
  <div class="col" id="rowInfo">
    <h5 id="headingFour">The Challenge</h5>
    <p>Since most parents only need to go through this process a handful of times, it did prove challenging to gather
      feedback without having to contact past parents who have long since forgotten their experience.
      <br><br>
      I also wanted to be mindful of not wanting to get in touch with parents for feedback. Parents are inundated with
      communication from the School regarding internal processes, finance related queries, school events and other
      school related updates such as newsletters. It was preferred to not engage our parents any further with
      communication and not overwhelm them with requests to complete surveys or for feedback.
      <br><br>
      I did have access to a team who help parents enrol daily. They did notice a collective theme in concerns parents
      share, which corroborated the data that we had on hand from usability tests and from our experience in the finance
      team from what parents have previously shared. In addition to this, I had access to our customer query logs to
      consider any other areas of concern for new parents, which would be addressed at a later stage as this case study
      is on-going.

      Our solution focused on the following:
      <li>Giving parents clear instructions on the enrollment process at the very beginning and within their eyeline so
        this would not be missed by parents.</li>

      <li>Removing fields that were deemed unnecessary from the admissions team to shorten this process.</li>

      <li>Lessening this process for current families that have already enrolled previously.</li>

      <li>Allowed parents to add additional students without needing to complete the guardian information again.</li>

      <li> A navigation bar was recommended on the homepage to ensure parents have a clear place to find information
        such as the fee guideline.</li>
      <br>

      <p>This case study is on-going, and is part of a much larger enrollment process, as changes are made this case
        study will evolve as I work with our Marketing and Admissions team to continue to make positive changes on this
        user experience for our parents.</p>
