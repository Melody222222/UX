  <p>The goal of this project was to review the online booking process for various websites. I would also have the opportunity to complete my first case study.<br>

      <lh>The Challenge:</lh>
      <p>The amount of additional steps users need to take to finalize and pay for a flight, such as having to go through
        the benefits page was not a fluid task for users who are price sensitive or just want to book a flight without any
        additional features.<br><br> This was a theme that became evident after 2 userability tests, and appeared to be the
        biggest source of frustration for the particular users I was exposed to.
      Users did find it confusing if the total amounts displayed on each page through this journey was for one passenger
        or total for both passengers.</p>

<div class="row"><h1>My Goal</h1>

  <div class="col">
 
    <ul>
      <li><p>To improve on a process that users go through often when booking a flight.</p></li>
      <li><p>Find a way to be aware of consumers who are financially conscious or users who only wish to book
        flights without add ons, while only recommending one feauture such as insurance. In my personal capacity and amongst
        discussions with a small peer group, insurance has been a feauture that many consider somewhat necessary, especially
        post pandemic.</p></li>
    </ul>

<div class="row"><h1>Reviewing the Data</h1>
  <p>Our Affinity workshop came together to find common challenges faced by users, it appeared that the areas that
    highlighted was with regards to instructions on the flight selection step, misunderstanding the total cart amount
    displayed, and alleviating the misconception that airlines push additional benefits onto consumers, I chose to focus
    on this area in particular.</p>

<div class="row"><h1>Define this Journey</h1>
  <p>A Customer Journey Map and user flow diagram found that Users who were simply looking to book a flight
    had to go through many additional unnecessary steps on the 3 websites I reviewed, either via a new window or a window that
    users had to scroll down to the bottom of the page to continue onto the payment page.</p>

<div class="row"><h1>Sketching...</h1>
 
  <p>My rough interaction design, my solution for users who wished to proceed to payments without being upsold
    feautures, was simply to click a button to allow users to skip pages with additional benefits and proceed straight to the
    checkout page, where the only feature that is shown in insurance, categorizing this more as a need to have than a
    benefit.

<div class="row"><h1>Results</h1>
  <p>The research validated that there was compelling feedback from users who wanted a leaner method to book a
    flight, considering life post pandemic, users might be
    more conservative with their spending. Insurance was included on the payment page for users not as an upsell, but as a recommendation. <br><br>
    I included an all inclusive amount, removing confusion on if the total in the cart is for one passenger or all passengers, either via an information icon
    to hover and be provided more details on what the total includes or for this to be stated under the price.<br>
   I am limited in my ability to account for the nuances from
    the viewpoint of a business. I only factored in what the consumer seemed to be asking for, a simplier shorter process.
    <br><br>
    My prototype allowed those financially cautious users the option to elimate steps that users found irrelevant
    by providing users the option to opt out of this step, this would give users the opportunity to shorten their booking
    process with a focus on empathy for that user in mind.
