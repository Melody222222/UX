              <ul><lh>User pain point based on feedback seemed to be:</lh>
                <li>Users had challenges finding instructions on selecting one of the three flight option and proceeding to the next step.
              </li>
              <li>The amount of additional steps users need to take to finalize and pay for a flight, such as having to go through the benefits page was not a fluid task for users who are price sensitive or just want to book a flight without any additional features.</li>
            <li>Users did find it confusing  if the total amounts displayed on each page through this journey was for one passenger or total for both passengers.</li>
         
        </ul>
        <ul>
       <lh> My Goal:</lh>
       <li>To have the opportunity to complete my first case study.</li>
        <li>To improve on a process that users go through often when booking a flight.</li>
        <li>Finding a way to be aware of consumers who are financially conscious or users who only wish to book flights without add ons when booking flights, while only recommending one feauture such as insurance.  In my personal capacity and amongst discussions with a small peer group, insurance has been a feauture that many consider somewhat necessary, especially post pandemic.</li>

          <h5 id="headingFour">Conducting Research</h5>Usability Testing: <h6>This was done with a review of 2 previous usability tests and conducting 1 usability test for flight bookings on two different websites</h6>
        <p>The biggest concern that became evident with these tests were that users who were finacially prudent were not keen on upselling of additional products and found these additional steps slightly pushy and aggressive. <br>Users found through the journey there was typically a cost associated with selecting one of the three flight options and a cost for an upgraded seat selection. As one of the users, when coming across these pages stated "This is where they get you" and skipping the benefits page, along with another user mentioning how expensive these benefits after a quick browse, and did not select anything, my focus was a solve for this.
       <br><br>Users also did struggle at certain points with selecting certain options and confusion with pricing.

                      <p>Our Affinity workshop came together to find common challenges faced by users, it appeared that the areas that highlighted was with regards to instructions on the flight selection step, misunderstanding the total cart amount displayed, and alleviating the misconception that airlines push additional benefits onto consumers even if they do not want them.</p>

    <h5 id="headingEight">Results</h5>
    I included instructions when selecting from the three flight options, while
    also providing more clarity on the cart total, removing confusion on if the total in the cart is for one passenger or a total for the given amount of passengers. <br><br>
                      The research results validated that there was compelling feedback from users who wanted a leaner method to book a flight, considering life post pandemic, users might be
                      more conservative with their spending in view of the current climate. Insurance was recommended for users as this feature was grouped as more of a necessity than benefit.<br>
                      
                      <br>My prototype allowed those financially cautious users the option to elimate steps that users found irrelevant
                      by providing users the option to opt out of this step, this would give users the opportunity to shorten their booking process with a focus on empathy for that user in mind. <br>
