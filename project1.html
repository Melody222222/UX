<h5 id="headingTwo">About:</h5>
<p>The goal of this project was to review the online booking process for various websites and use this information to
  benefit users. I would also have the opportunity to complete my first case study.<br>

</p>
</div>

<h5 id="headingThree">The Challenge:</h5>
</div>

<ul>
  <lh>User pain point based on feedback:</lh>
  <li>Users had challenges finding instructions on selecting one of the three flight option and proceeding to the next
    step.
  </li>
  <li>The amount of additional steps users need to take to finalize and pay for a flight, such as having to go through
    the benefits page was not a fluid task for users who are price sensitive or just want to book a flight without any
    additional features. This was a theme that became evident after 2 userability tests, <br>and appeared to be the
    biggest source of frustration for the particular users I was exposed to.</li>
  <li>Users did find it confusing if the total amounts displayed on each page through this journey was for one passenger
    or total for both passengers.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
  <lh> My Goal:</lh>

  <li>To improve on a process that users go through often when booking a flight.</li>
  <li>Especially finding a way to be aware of consumers who are financially conscious or users who only wish to book
    flights without add ons, while only recommending one feauture such as insurance. In my personal capacity and amongst
    discussions with a small peer group, insurance has been a feauture that many consider somewhat necessary, especially
    post pandemic.</li>
</ul>

  <h5 id="headingFive">Reviewing All The Data</h5>
  <p>Our Affinity workshop came together to find common challenges faced by users, it appeared that the areas that
    highlighted was with regards to instructions on the flight selection step, misunderstanding the total cart amount
    displayed, and alleviating the misconception that airlines push additional benefits onto consumers, I chose to focus
    on this area in particular.</p>

  <h5 id="headingSix">Defining Users Experiences</h5>
  <p>A Customer Journey Map and user flow diagram provided clarity on which steps users found most challenging. The step
    for additional benefits appeared to be the step that my users found to be bothersome and users mentioned it felt
    like they were seeing pages or steps that they did not want to view. Users who were simply looking to book a flight
    had to go through these additional steps on the 3 websites I reviewed, either via a new window or a window that
    users had to scroll down to the bottom of the page to continue onto the payment page.</p>

  <h5 id="headingSeven">Sketching & Prototyping</h5>
  <div class="col" id="rowInfo">
    <p>I started sketching a rough interaction design for desktop booking process and finding ways to make this process
      a better experience for a users. My solution for users who wished to proceed to payments without being upsold
      feautures,
      was simply to click a button to allow users to skip pages with additional benefits and proceed straight to the
      checkout page, where, the only feature that is shown in insurance, categorizing this more as a need to have than a
      benefit.

<div class="col">
  <h5 id="headingEight">Results</h5>
  I included instructions when selecting from the three flight options, while
  removing confusion on if the total in the cart is for one passenger or all passengers, either via an information icon
  to hover and be provided more details on what the total includes or for this to be stated under the price.<br>
  <br> The research results validated that there was compelling feedback from users who wanted a leaner method to book a
  flight, considering life post pandemic, users might be
  more conservative with their spending in view of the current climate. Insurance was included on the payment page for
  users not as an upsell, but as a recommendation. <br><br> I am limited in my ability to account for the nuances from
  the viewpoint of a business. I only factored in what the consumer seemed to be asking for, a simplier shorter process.
  <br><br>
  My prototype allowed those financially cautious users the option to elimate steps that users found irrelevant
  by providing users the option to opt out of this step, this would give users the opportunity to shorten their booking
  process with a focus on empathy for that user in mind.
